            <li>Project entities are split into two core categories: 1.<strong>Devices</strong> and 2.<strong>Assets</strong>. Devices include all MEP equipment. Assets include buildings and each floor or main demise within each building</li>
            <li>Each project entity has two data types: 1.Static/semi-static <strong>Attributes</strong> and 2.Timeseries <strong>Telemetry</strong>. Entities are mapped to <strong>Entities</strong> in the navigation menu</li>
            <li>Static/semi-static data are data points that dont change or change infrequently. This could be a design parameter or a parameter that gets logged once per month</li>
            <li>Timeseries data are data points that change frequently and are recorded at fixed time intervals, typically every 15 mintes. An example would be electrical power from a power meter</li>

            <li>Project assets are the buildng and the floors or demises within each building. Each asset name contains the <strong>NNNN</strong> identifier from the PROJECT_NNNN project ID </li>
